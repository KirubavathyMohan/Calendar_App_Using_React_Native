This project is designed to leverage Babel and Expo for building a React Native application. The configuration files included are essential for setting up the development environment and ensuring smooth operation of the application.

Key Features
Babel Configuration: Utilizes Babel to transpile modern JavaScript and JSX syntax, making it compatible with older environments.
Expo Integration: Integrates with Expo, a framework and platform for universal React applications, simplifying the development process.
Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a structured and efficient setup for developing mobile applications using React Native, enabling developers to focus on building features rather than configuration.

Components
Babel Configuration (babel.config.js): Configures Babel to use the babel-preset-expo, optimizing the build process for Expo applications.
TypeScript Declaration File (expo-env.d.ts): Provides type definitions for Expo, enhancing the development experience with TypeScript support.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the installation instructions provided in the README. Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, and you will be ready to develop your mobile application.

Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational setup for developers looking to create mobile applications using React Native and Expo, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.
